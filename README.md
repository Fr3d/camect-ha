As a learning exercise, I have written a more featureful Home Assistant integration for the [Camect Hub](https://camect.com/). It provides fully-fledged devices and entities for the hub, its cameras, and motion detection alerts.

Many thanks to the Camect team for providing something I could learn from with their [original Home Assistant code](https://github.com/camect/home-assistant-integration), and for their [camect-py](https://github.com/camect/camect-py) library.

I suggest treating this as beta quality for now. It's been working great for me for a few weeks, however YMMV ðŸ˜Š

## Installation ##
Using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) to install is the recommended method. Add the URL for this repo as a custom repository, and then install it using the Explore & Download button.
Ensure you pick the correct repo, as there's a similar one for the original Camect team's code. Look for this repo's description; "Camect Hub integration for Home Assistant / HACS".

If you install it manually you _might_ need to add one line to your `configuration.yaml` before Home Assistant will detect it:
```yaml
camect:
```

1. Add a local account (not a "cloud" account like Google) to your Hub for the integration to authenticate with.
   1. At the time of writing, the API only works for users granted Administrator privileges.
   2. ![Add local Camect Hub user](https://github.com/Fr3d/camect-ha/blob/main/add_ha_user.png?raw=true)
2. Once the integration is installed in Home Assistant, add the integration from your Settings -> Integrations page and search for Camect.
3. Fill in the username and password you setup above.
   1. Most people won't need to change the URL as `local.home.camect.com` provides a redirects to the Hub running in your home.
   2. ![Camect HA Config](https://github.com/Fr3d/camect-ha/blob/main/ha_configuration.png?raw=true)
4. Assuming it successfully connects after submitting the form, the integration will ask you to set the areas (rooms) for the Hub and every camera it finds.
